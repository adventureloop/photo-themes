# photo-themes

This is a collection of some themes to give me a starting point when I can't think what to shoot. 

The list was collected from:
http://www.betterphoto.com/contest/themes.asp
https://photographyicon.com/photography-themes/
http://blog.photoscramble.com/2012/09/05/worlds-longest-list-of-photo-contest-ideas/
http://www.apogeephoto.com/151-things-to-photograph-a-z/
http://www.theatreofnoise.com/2008/05/250-photography-themes.html
http://gomakesomething.com/ht/thebasics/theme-ideas/

I edited it down a bit by deleting some things that I didn't think I'd want to go with, then noticed the list had 1347 entries so deleted another 10.

A randomly selected entry from the list can be obtained at http://theme.bodaegl.com
